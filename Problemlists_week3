1) Research: Compare>> Creating Data type using Literal or Constructor
In summary, calling dict() requires these steps:

Find the object associated with the name "dict" and push it onto the stack.
Push the key/value pairs onto the stack as constant values.
Get the key/value pairs off of the stack and create a dictionary to hold the keyword arguments to the function.
Call the constructor for dict to make a new object.
Initialize the new object by passing the keyword arguments to its initialization method.
3) Research: relationship between being a dynamically typed language and pointer
Many dynamic programming languages are nothing but pointers.
However *you* are not allowed to take direct advantage of that.

More properly these are called ‘references’,
 which means ‘a pointer that the user cannot change,
  other than perhaps by replacing with the value from another reference’.

Much of what dynamic programming environments offer requires
that objects not be allocated on the processor’s stack,
and hence any function’s local variables are actually pointers to data allocated on the heap.

4) Research: tuple methods
5) Rock, Paper, Scissor
6) pop-Wiz with range
7) studying methods for dictionaries
8) compare python and java script which appropirate for data science and why?
